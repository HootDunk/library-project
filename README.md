#Library Project

A project to practice using/creating objects in javascript.  Keep information about your books and keep track of what you have and haven't read.  I decided to learn some of Firebase and just connected it so that the data is there at later sessions.  I had to re-write a lot of the original code so that the rendering was based around successfully reading and writing data (wouldn't be too helpful if it rendered on the front end but there was an error on the backend).
