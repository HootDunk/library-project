#Library Project

A project to practice using/creating objects in javascript.  Keep information about your books and keep track of what you have and haven't read.  I decided to learn Firebase and connected the project to Firestore.  I had to re-write a lot of the original code so that the rendering was based around successfully reading and writing data (It'd be a little misleading if it rendered on the front end but there was an error on the backend).
